Some notes about HIFI's Sandbox Environment
===========================================


Sandbox has a few key areas in which it differs from Production


* Customers are automatically approved (no KYC/KYB flow)
* There is no real money movement in Sandbox
* The wallet addresses are created for testnets. A wallet address is a unique identifier that allows for the sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies. A testnet is a network that's similar to the mainnet but is used for testing and experimenting without real money movements. Read more about the difference between mainnet and testnet [here](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/mainnet-vs-testnet/).
